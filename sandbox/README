# RMEM Config
To run anything other than stock behavior you must copy spark-defaults.conf to
spark/conf. Modify to your needs.

# Running jobs remotely

1. conf/slaves
Setup spark/conf/slaves to have the hostnames of the slaves you want to use.
It is recommended that the master not be on the list (either localhost or the 
name of the node you're running these scripts from).

2. Initialize spark on slaves (will copy your current spark directory to slaves)
./setup-distr.sh

3. Run your test
Pass "--master spark://$(hostname):7077" to bin/spark-submit. Most tests should
have a run script setup to do this.

4. Shutdown and cleanup (won't clean up local files, just stops the spark jobs)
./stop-distr.sh

## Gotcha's
It seems that sometimes (paricularly after exceptions) that spark workers and/or
the master stick around, even after calling ./stop-distr.sh. If things are
acting weird or giving unexpected exceptions, try logging into your slaves and
running "ps -Af | grep spark" and killing any workers you find. Likewise for
the master.
